# NLP-Persian-Poets
In this project I tried to use NLP methods for categorizing different types of texts into 3 sets. one for each of the poets. 
I used a dataset that cointains the poems written by 3 different poets. By the use of the training dataset I created a unigram and a bigram model that I used these models to guess 
the poets of the test dataset. And by changing the coefficients of the back-off model I reached to the accuracy of above 85%.
